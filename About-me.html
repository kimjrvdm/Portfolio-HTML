<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm Kimberly Jill V. De Mesa. I was born on 25th day of April, 1993. I am the eldest daughter of the family and
  I have 7 siblings. I studied Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Communications Engineering. I have only finished 4
  and a half years in college. I am married with three wonderful kids. My first job was, I am a Warehouse Staff in Smart
  Communications Inc. where I worked there with sim cards. We do packed thousands of sim cards everyday. I only worked
  there for five months.
</p>

<p>My second job, I became an Electronics Technician. I was familiarized with the Electronics equipments/components which
  relatably with the course I studied. I only worked there for three months. My third job was I became a Sales Promoter in
  SM Aura. I sell high-end products specifically headphones like Beats by Dre. I was also trained to sell and explain the
  specifications of laptops. I worked there for 10 months.
</p>

<p>I also worked as an Admin Staff where I did paper works, outsales, documentations, scheduling of returning fixed defective
  items. I have also worked in BPO industries. I was a Customer Service Representative. I've been a lot into interacting customers,
  sales, whether face to face or via phone. The reason I changed career from Sales to Web Developing is that I find this career so
  challenging and it will help me to build more and learn more hard skills as the technologies improving from time to time. What I
  learned from my previous jobs are soft skills which helped me to grow, I can work in team. I can empathize, and I believe that you can always
  learn from everyone regardless of experiences and age.
